# CS50 Web Programming Project - Search

Welcome to my inaugural project for the CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course.  
In this project, I have designed a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.

## Project Demo

I've created a video demonstration of this project to showcase its functionality and features.  
I encourage you to watch the demo to get a better understanding of how the project works and see it in action.
